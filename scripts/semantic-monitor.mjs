/**
 * SEMANTIC DRIFT MONITOR.
 *
 * Every interpreter/CPython divergence found in this project so far was found
 * by accident: a corpus case happened to use a construct nobody had exercised,
 * and the execution-truth gate caught it. That worked, but it is luck with a
 * long tail — `Σ` waited 119 programs, `with` waited 134, and `%`-formatting
 * was broken for everything past `%s`/`%d`/`%f` the whole time.
 *
 * This turns that luck into a check. It reports two things:
 *
 *   COVERAGE — which shipped EML constructs no corpus program exercises. A
 *   construct at zero is a construct whose semantics nothing is testing, which
 *   is precisely where the divergences have been hiding.
 *
 *   DRIFT — semantics-bearing source files whose content hash has changed since
 *   the last recorded baseline, WITHOUT the matching conformance test being
 *   touched. Editing how `%` formats or how a cache keys is exactly the kind of
 *   change that should not land quietly.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/semantic-monitor.mjs                    # report; exit 1 on a regression
 *   node scripts/semantic-monitor.mjs --accept           # record the current state
 *   node scripts/semantic-monitor.mjs --accept --why "…" # …required if alerts are open
 *
 * ── The ledger ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `scripts/semantic-monitor.jsonl` is an append-only record of what this
 * monitor has SEEN, alongside the baseline that records what it EXPECTS.
 *
 * The baseline alone was not enough. It stores a snapshot, so accepting an
 * alert overwrites the evidence: the alert fires, `--accept` moves the
 * baseline, and afterwards nothing in the repo says the alert ever existed or
 * why it was waved through. Since reaching for `--accept` is exactly the
 * temptation that shows up when you should be looking harder, an unauditable
 * accept is the weakest point in the whole design.
 *
 * So every run appends what it observed, and every acceptance appends what was
 * accepted — with a REASON, required whenever alerts are open. You can still
 * accept anything; you can no longer accept it silently.
 *
 * One line per event:
 *
 *   {"stream":"eml","proto":"eml-monitor-v1","seq":1,
 *    "ts":"2026-07-30T…","type":"monitor:alert","file":"…","reason":"…"}
 *
 *   monitor:run       every run — corpus size, construct count, alert count
 *   monitor:alert     one per alert raised
 *   monitor:accept    baseline recorded, carrying the reason given
 *
 * Structure borrowed from the append-only channel PHOSPHOR uses for agent
 * handoff — the SHAPE is a good idea worth reusing. The names are EML's own:
 * this project was deliberately made independent, and a monitor is not the
 * place to quietly reintroduce another project's vocabulary.
 *
 * Writing the ledger is best-effort. A monitor that cannot append must still
 * report, because failing to record is not a reason to stop checking.
 *
 * The baseline lives in scripts/semantic-monitor.baseline.json and is committed,
 * so the alert is about CHANGE rather than about absolute numbers — a construct
 * that was already at zero yesterday is reported but does not fail the build;
 * a construct that DROPS to zero, or a semantics file that moves without its
 * test, does.
