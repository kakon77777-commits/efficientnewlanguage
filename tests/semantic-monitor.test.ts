/**
 * The monitor runs as part of the suite, not only as a command someone
 * remembers to type. There is no CI workflow in this repo, so `pnpm test` is
 * the only thing guaranteed to run before a commit — a monitor that has to be
 * invoked by hand is a monitor that reports to nobody.
 *
 * What it can fail on:
 *   - a semantics-bearing file changed without its conformance test
 *   - an EML construct stopped being exercised by any corpus program
 *
 * Neither is automatically a bug. The failure means "look at this", and
 * `pnpm monitor:accept` records the new state once it has been looked at.
 *
 * WHERE THESE RUNS ARE RECORDED. Drilling the monitor for real is the point of
 * this file — a mocked monitor would prove nothing about the one that runs.
 * But the monitor's ledger is the committed record of what actually happened,
 * and until this was fixed every suite run appended eleven lines of rehearsal
 * to it: two runs, an accept, a refusal, an accept, and the runs those imply.
 * Measured on the tree at 6d5d394, one `vitest run` of this file added 2295
 * bytes and 11 lines to `scripts/semantic-monitor.jsonl`.
 *
 * So every spawn below passes `--ledger` and writes to a disposable file. Two
 * things are deliberately NOT redirected:
 *
 *   - the two integrity tests read the COMMITTED ledger, because what they
 *     check is that artifact's well-formedness and sequence monotonicity, and
 *     pointing them at a file this test just created would test nothing;
 *   - the product default is untouched, which the null control in the
 *     handback measures rather than assumes.
