/**
 * BUILTIN ARGUMENT SHAPES — differential gate against real CPython.
 *
 * The corpus reached 149 programs with every tracked SYNTAX construct covered,
 * which made it look finished. Measuring a different axis said otherwise: of
 * the ten builtins the interpreter implements, five (`abs`, `float`, `min`,
 * `set`, `sum`) were called by ZERO corpus programs, and the other five were
 * only ever called with one argument.
 *
 * Probing the uncovered shapes against CPython found twelve divergences. The
 * lesson is the same one `%`-formatting taught: coverage of a NAME proves
 * nothing. `str` appeared in 130 programs and was fine; `float` appeared in
 * none and was wrong five different ways.
 *
 * Every row below failed before the fix that accompanies this file. They are
 * kept as a set rather than prose so that adding a shape is one line, and so
 * the comparison is against CPython rather than against my belief about it.
